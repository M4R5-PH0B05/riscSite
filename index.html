        <h1>What do RISC and CISC mean?</h1>
        <p>RISC and CISC are two different types of CPU architecure which both focus on seperate things.
            <!--Information on specifically RISC-->
            RISC stands for <b>Reduced Instruction Set Computing</b>, and has several key features,
            with the main ones being:
            <ul>
                <li>Simple, Fixed length instructions and single cycle instructions</li>
                <li>Many general purpose registers rather than specific registers</li>
                <li>The ability to use pipelining - which is the execution of multiple
                    different instructions at the same time. 
            </ul>
            <!--Information on specifically CISC-->
            CISC stands for <b>Complex Instruction Set Computing</b>, and It's main features are as follows:
            <ul>
                <li>Complex, Variable length instructions which can take multiple cycles</li>
                <li>Can operate directly on memory</li>
                <li>Fewer registers which are more specialized</li>
            </ul>

        <h1>What are the Advantages / Disadvantages of RISC?</h1>
        <p>RISC is usually used with ARM (Advanced RISC machines) processors, which are commonly
            associated with mobile devices. They are also used in embedded systems,
            and high performance computing.<br><br>
            <!--Advantages-->
            <b>Advantages</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Faster execution of instructions that are individual</li>
                <li>The hardware design of the chip is simpler, and therefore easier 
                    to manufacture for companies.
                </li>
                <li>It has a lower power consumption than CISC</li>
            </ul>
            <!--Disadvantages-->
            <b>Disadvantages</b>
            <ul>
                <li>RISC processors may require more instructions in order to 
                    peform tasks that are more complex
                </li>
                <li>The code that is written for these chips is most likely going 
                    to be longer
                </li>
            </ul>
